Initially, the idea of this project is that developers can participate in a real (open source) project in which they can gain experience, learn from different methodologies, good practices, understand design patterns and among other topics that are normally covered in a project in real life.
As such, the project is totally free, any developer who is part of the team has access to the code and it's totally free.
